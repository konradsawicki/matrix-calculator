## Description

### General

This application allows the user to choose beetween three different path finding algorithms and visualise them. <br>
There is a possibility of creating obstacles, moving the Start Node and the End Node. <br>
I created this project to help me better understand path finding algorithms.

### Programming languages and libraries

 - C++ (OOP, Polymorphism, Multithreading, STL)
 - SFML

### Main features

- Menu
- Ability to choose between different path finding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's, Wavefront)
- Creating/erasing obstacles
- Ability to move the Start Node and the End Node
- Visualisation of the selected algorithm

## Usage

 - Improving knowledge about path finding algorithms
 - Visualisation of path finding algorithms
